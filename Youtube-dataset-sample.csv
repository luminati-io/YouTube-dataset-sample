"UgwHRhIwst8Uf--Katt4AaABAg","Test drove both, a non-Foundation CT and 3 RWD yesterday. Been $100 res holder for long time & wanted to compare. Loved the 3, amazingly quiet with all the “rough edges” filed off. Liked the CT, especially the steer by wire and turning radius. Pulled thru parking garage at local casino and everyone was staring at us. Thought that novelty had worn off? CT drives much smaller than it looks. But that bed is huge! Tried FSD on both and the 3 seems much smoother & refined. Right now 3 is winning, far more practical. CT still on the radar though. Actively watching for a 3 inventory deal & hope to take advantage of the lease loophole. Thanks for the experienced Tesla owners viewpoint. The ones we looked at would have been high $40’s vs high $70’s respectively with CT taxes about double, including the military discount. Hope to get lease deal $7500 before it all goes away. Colorado EV deals are amazing but I’ll take zero state income taxes instead,  thank you.",1,1,"@vb███6","https://www.youtube.com/@vb9166","1 day ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_-ffXM56Bw","y_-ffXM56Bw","[{""reply_id"":""UgwHRhIwst8Uf--Katt4AaABAg.ABj95vyRhM3ABl98RTKDor"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""The 3 is on the next generation of FSD, version 13.

When the historic Abraham Accords were signed, Zvi was on one of the first flights over to the UAE to assist a non-Israeli Rabbi already working there. He, like every other Israeli I know, was so over the top excited about the prospect of new peace deals popping up and he was so happy to be a part of it. It wasn’t long before he was in the UAE, devoted to his holy work which was to be a source of assistance to the Jews of the gulf states, especially with regards to the procurement of Kosher food.

At some point he traveled to New York, met a nice Jewish girl and got married. Afterwards, they both returned to the UAE to continue their work.

 I don’t think many people realize the sacrifice that entails. Jewish religious life is heavily dependent upon a robust Jewish communal structure- to have synagogues, Jewish schools, kosher food etc. For a young couple to leave both Israel and New York, the centers of Jewish life, to travel to a place like the UAE where almost no Jews live, far away from friends and family, just in order to be of assistance to those who might need their services, is a tremendous  sacrifice. And, in general, that’s what Chabad does. Young couples, often with small children, leave massive Jewish centers and settle in remote places like Siberia, Thailand and the UAE. 

Zvi wasn’t just a friend from school. He was a Jewish hero, like all Chabad emissaries who devote their lives to spreading goodness and kindness, teaching lessons from Torah and generally making the world a better place. 

As the leader of the Chabad movement, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson once said, “why did G-d create humanity from one man? To teach us that all men are of equal value and worth, as they all derive from just one man, Adam.” Zvi’s number one goal in life was to bring the teachings of Rabbi Schneerson into actuality. And the world was a better place for it. 

May his memory be a blessing.",31,2,"@Sc███urZ███anE█████████w","https://www.youtube.com/@SchneurZalmanEhven-it5zw","6 days ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNtWsI6LCt0&pp=ygUHanVkYWlzbQ%3D%3D","HNtWsI6LCt0","[{""reply_id"":""Ugzl53tvPnc3m3oFJCl4AaABAg.ABJKYO-MuG7ABJcMtRgA6L"",""reply_like"":6,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""I’m so sorry for your loss! 💔🕯️ It breaks my heart to see all the suffering of the Jews and Israelis, just because of these demon possessed people. 😢 Send you all my love and big hugs from Germany! ❤ 🇩🇪"",""user_id"":""UCdEjO9hCkXud1Bji7_qgPRA"",""user_id_md5"":""163003e7401cdae7feb0f0e9f8cdb455"",""user_name"":""@iv911"",""user_name_md5"":""63ad4a2b10ff2cd6c80594486c12b761""},{""reply_id"":""Ugzl53tvPnc3m3oFJCl4AaABAg.ABJKYO-MuG7ABJnWwjGafA"",""reply_like"":6,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""Thank you for sharing this information about his life and Chabad workers.

"UgwI1iVuXpmWSGedDzZ4AaABAg","Parallel Judaisms I’d like to see:

— What if “ ״ לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו had been interpreted ONLY ATO forbid that one specific action — so that, for instance, it’s OK to cook a kosher animal in the milk of a different species of kosher animal, and it’s also OK to cook a kosher animal in kosher milk (even of the same species) IF the animal isn’t a baby animal?

— Conversely, what if the law had been extended MORE widely, to forbid serving chicken with eggs st the same meal (no chicken-egg-salad sandwiches), and to forbid serving caviar with fish (e.g., at a catered event’s sushi bar)? 

Or … on a not-so-dietary subject … what if Jewish law had been interpreted to allow/encourage all diaspora communities to build their own temples (not jus synagogues, but actual finctining replicas of the בית המקדש)  and to there continue to carry out at leasr some of the sacrifices/certsin kinds of sacrifices) and other Biblical temple rituals requiring a temple  (maybe just a few of them: נזיר, סוטה, etc.)

Or … closer to our own day and situation: what if the Zionist movement had kept with Herzl’s original plan to build the Jewish state, not in Israel, but in Uganda? And/or …  what if (also in line with that themeof “what if now-forgotten early Zionist proposals had been carried our) what if Israel, when adopting/revitalizing Hebrew as its revived national language, had gone along with Vladimir Jabotinsky’s proposal that the revived language should be written in Roman letters (the alphabet used for English and for most other zEuropean languages) going left-to-right as the Roman alphabet normally does? (in our own world, Jabotinsky, or his followers actually briefly published a newspaper who is Hebrew was written in this way. The newspaper, and the Romanization movement for Hebrew, quickly failed: but what if they had succeeded? What forces might have led such a movement to succeed? What would Jewish educatio &  Jewish culture today, be like generally, worldwide, if Hebrew — modern Hebrew at least — had ended up being ridden henceforth in the Roman alphabet rather than in the Hebrew אלף-בית ?

Or … a this one is really huge alternate-universe change: what if the Christian religion had never really caught on, and Judaism had caught on instead (in all the parts of the world that are now majority-Christian or at least culturally Christian?) this one could be played in two ways: either make it that Christianity never even got started (or just died) or … even more intriguingly … make it that Christianity lasted only as an extremely minority/unpopular religion, accounting for less than 2% of the world population? In other words, in this alternate universe, the number of Jews in the world is about the same as the number of Christians in the real world, and the number of Christians in the world is about the same as the number of Jews, in the real world: instead of there being countries where Christianity is a deep part of the culture (even among the non-Christians in those countries), the world is full of countries where Judaism is a deep part of the culture … the default calendar of the world is the Hebrew calendar rather than the Gregorian one and, oh, yes, there is ONE tiny and controversial and precariously extant Christian nation state, founded 76 years ago in the year 5785 … note, in this connection, that in this world, Islam doesn’t exist because (the real world) Islam contains a lot that comes from Christianity, as well as a lot that comes from. The people who would be Muslims in the real world are, in this world, either Jews or possibly from some. Karaite-type quasi-Jewish sect thst got started about 1300 years ago by a member of one of the (many [in that world] Jewish tribes of Arabs (even in our real world, before the rise of Islam there were many Jewish tribes of Arabs) …

"UgykLw1F8SQyorRmlMl4AaABAg","GPT(calculation) : 
Main Question:
""Given the historical and theological relationships between Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, calculate the probability of each being a prophet based on the following assumptions:

Moses is a prophet who lived 3,000 years ago, called God by the name Yahweh.
Jesus is a prophet who lived 2,000 years ago, also called God by the name Yahweh, but with some theological differences from Moses (e.g., Jesus’ divinity in Christianity).
Muhammad is a prophet who lived 1,400 years ago, called God by the name Allah, and presented contradictions to Moses and Jesus’ teachings in his Quran.
What are the probabilities that each of them is a prophet if Moses is a prophet, assuming different levels of alignment or divergence between Jesus and Moses?""

Summary of Calculations:
Scenario 1: Jesus Aligns with Moses

Moses' Probability (P(M)): 50% chance that Moses is a prophet.
Jesus' Probability (P(J)): 30% chance that Jesus is a prophet, given Moses is a prophet and they share a similar understanding of God.
Muhammad's Probability (P(H)): 9% chance that Muhammad is a prophet, given Moses and Jesus are prophets but Muhammad’s teachings contradict theirs.
Scenario 2: Jesus Does Not Align with Moses

Moses' Probability (P(M)): 50% chance that Moses is a prophet.
Jesus' Probability (P(J)): 15% chance that Jesus is a prophet, given significant theological divergence from Moses.
Muhammad's Probability (P(H)): 4.5% chance that Muhammad is a prophet, given theological contradictions with both Moses and Jesus.
Conclusion:
If Jesus aligns with Moses, the probability of Jesus being a prophet is 30%, and the probability of Muhammad being a prophet is 9%.
If Jesus does not align with Moses, the probability of Jesus being a prophet drops to 15%, and Muhammad’s probability drops to 4.5%.",1,6,"@un███led███4","https://www.youtube.com/@untitled7184","6 days ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNtWsI6LCt0&pp=ygUHanVkYWlzbQ%3D%3D","HNtWsI6LCt0","[{""reply_id"":""UgykLw1F8SQyorRmlMl4AaABAg.ABJZErVGkn_ABJmU_zSznd"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""Conclusion: Anyone can regard anyone as a prophet based on their own subjective criteria, but it’s more insightful to present the reasoning behind those conclusions than to simply show probabilities calculated by an algorithmic bot.\n\nKeep in mind, an AI bot can be fine-tuned to reflect biased opinions and viewpoints, or, in other words, personalized.

It’s easy to label something an atrocity when you ignore the context and cherry pick facts. \n       FACT IS this wasn’t stolen from anyone it was mostly desert and unsettled, undeveloped land. During negotiations with the Jews the incoming Israeli government made it clear that they wanted the Arabs to remain and become full and equal members and citizens of The State of Israel. The Arabs who did stay became exactly that. Today Israel despite accusations of being an Apartheid state, is the only nation in that region with equal rights for all citizens. Arab Muslims are on the Supreme Court, they sit in cabinet and high ranked government seats. An Arab sentenced a former Jewish leader in Israel to prison. Don’t tell me it’s Apartheid.\n         It was Arabs who said no\nTo the peel commission partition plan , the to the UN partition plan, all because they didn’t want Jews to have a State of their own. That’s why they told hundreds of thousands of Arabs to leave temporarily, and come back after they dealt with Israel. Only ISRAEL WON. That’s not ethnic cleansing.\n       If the Arabs wanted to create the State of Palestine why have they said NO to every deal that would give them one.

Noah said that Will is still in love with Mike in s5 and in a bts picture they showed us that Will spelled ""lover"" in a words game because he's gonna have a lover (Mike) or that he's gonna be a lover (it still means that he's getting into a relationship, when Joyce said ""you're not gonna think it's gross when you fall in love"" she meant "" when you find a bf"" but she didn't want Will to realize that she knows that he's gay and when Will said this he meant ""i'm not gonna find a bf"" (Will's boyfriend is gonna be Mike), if Byler wasn't gonna be a thing they would've given Will a boyfriend in s2 since Will was already in love with Mike in s1 but they didn't, while with Dustin they gave him a gf in s3 cuz Max liked Lucas instead of him and they made him move on from Max, they didn't do this with Will cuz Mike loves him back, Will's character arc is about getting romantic love even though he thinks he doesn't deserve it cuz he's gay but he's gonna get proved wrong",3,3,"@by███.tr███er8██████","https://www.youtube.com/@byler.truther8129","6 days ago (edited)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLCWYfRvCmo&pp=ygUDamV3","BLCWYfRvCmo","[{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABHN9XYMpqb"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""this is a really long comment sorry"",""user_id"":""UC-Iq56qrgAszvMiYud3pyqg"",""user_id_md5"":""fdfe2d8de1f0ab9fc354e009bba1144b"",""user_name"":""@byler.truther8129"",""user_name_md5"":""e2e33c8061f6705d38886ad83e8f8c5c""},{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABK-H-zmUpQ"",""reply_like"":2,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""​ @byler.truther8129  I know lol  l felt like l was reading a essayy l love how much us bylers are passionate about byler"",""user_id"":""UCdl3YpHKadDC9IIYj4t-vdw"",""user_id_md5"":""3a096af13e810e017376993346a8c78f"",""user_name"":""@GabisileSibindi"",""user_name_md5"":""165fc014fdf706fed266fc1c4fd07feb""},{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABK-URYZXsQ"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":2,""reply_text"":""I do agree with u because why would will say it first and feel like the duffer brothers told him to make the playlist they know what they are doing hopefully it's not just a coincidence or they are queer baiting us other l will likely find them in their sleep"",""user_id"":""UCdl3YpHKadDC9IIYj4t-vdw"",""user_id_md5"":""3a096af13e810e017376993346a8c78f"",""user_name"":""@GabisileSibindi"",""user_name_md5"":""165fc014fdf706fed266fc1c4fd07feb""}]","e2e33c8061f6705d38886ad83e8f8c5c","[{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABHN9XYMpqb"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""this is a really long comment sorry"",""user_id_md5"":""fdfe2d8de1f0ab9fc354e009bba1144b"",""user_name_md5"":""e2e33c8061f6705d38886ad83e8f8c5c""},{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABK-H-zmUpQ"",""reply_like"":2,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""​ @byler.truther8129  I know lol  l felt like l was reading a essayy l love how much us bylers are passionate about byler"",""user_id_md5"":""3a096af13e810e017376993346a8c78f"",""user_name_md5"":""165fc014fdf706fed266fc1c4fd07feb""},{""reply_id"":""UgwTSk3UxBu4b5sJSq14AaABAg.ABHN7K7vkeTABK-URYZXsQ"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":2,""reply_text"":""I do agree with u because why would will say it first and feel like the duffer brothers told him to make the playlist they know what they are doing hopefully it's not just a coincidence or they are queer baiting us other l will likely find them in their sleep"",""user_id_md5"":""3a096af13e810e017376993346a8c78f"",""user_name_md5"":""165fc014fdf706fed266fc1c4fd07feb""}]"

"UgwMvHQkpyxu0Ci31ah4AaABAg","Almost 3 hour long video and you didn’t even talk about the Blue x Yellow theory which to me is basically canon at this point, which goes to show how much evidence there is. To put it simply, a part of the code from Season 3 was “when blue and yellow meet in the West [..]”. Fans thought that this had something to do with Byler and it was only confirmed when they met in California in Season 4 (the West). The reason fans associate them with those colors is because they often wear them: Mike- blue, and Will-yellow. When they switch colors, according to the theory, it means that they will have a fight, which holds up both in Season 3 and Season 4 (the garage and Rink-O-Mania). Their rooms are in those colors, etc. The biggest proof for me of this theory was the Rink-O-Mania scene, where everything is in yellow and blue lighting. When El hits Angela in the face and Mike and Will stand beside her, they have two bright respectively blue and yellow lights glowing above their heads, it’s almost on the nose. They proceed to wear their according colors as their relationship develops throughout the season. 💙💛",5,2,"@el███pet███a91███","https://www.youtube.com/@elliepetrova911","4 days ago (edited)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLCWYfRvCmo&pp=ygUDamV3","BLCWYfRvCmo","[{""reply_id"":""UgwMvHQkpyxu0Ci31ah4AaABAg.ABOVjC9c52mABOfsctwhwD"",""reply_like"":3,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""Thank you for commenting!

"Ugxl3BMLPy1JfUKvYz14AaABAg","I think part of why he was upset when Will gives him the painting is because he does know it wasn't the truth. He knows El told him about the painting and said she thought it was for a girl, it wouldn't make much sense for her to have told him that if she had commissioned the painting for him. Sure you could argue he may think she did that so it was an even bigger surprise that it is for him, but she could not mention it altogether and have that same effect. Plus, if it was she who commissioned it, why wasn't she the one who had it at the airport and given to him right away? I think Mike has picked up on those things, is really disappointed when Will does finally give it to him, confirming those feelings he has are unrequited, just for him to go back on it, he knows Will his hiding his true feelings, which further confirms he needs to do the same, leaving him feeling really disappointed because for a brief moment he thought they could maybe share their feelings, just for that hope to be swiftly taken away.",6,0,"@js███678███","https://www.youtube.com/@jsim26787","5 days ago (edited)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLCWYfRvCmo&pp=ygUDamV3","BLCWYfRvCmo","[{""reply_id"":""Ugw6cxVG8CqamxCfW2F4AaABAg.ABMSoq3JIUOABMfM90CTlW"",""reply_like"":14,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""This is very true but the way mike acts towards will is very different from how he acts towards dustin for example"",""user_id"":""UC8tW0mAtGE9wZnNldft5x3w"",""user_id_md5"":""9579e5b2c22274fbde32b2c84f899509"",""user_name"":""@franksocean"",""user_name_md5"":""f5d937b68c240281ffb7d09d377581a1""}]","40ca02a6e2b0586dca564590912606e9","[{""reply_id"":""Ugw6cxVG8CqamxCfW2F4AaABAg.ABMSoq3JIUOABMfM90CTlW"",""reply_like"":14,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""This is very true but the way mike acts towards will is very different from how he acts towards dustin for example"",""user_id_md5"":""9579e5b2c22274fbde32b2c84f899509"",""user_name_md5"":""f5d937b68c240281ffb7d09d377581a1""}]"

"Ugx1c45H04z09KHCWVV4AaABAg","Another thing is, I feel like people shouldn’t hate on Mike as much as they do. He was clearly going through depression throughout the seasons, and you can see him sort of pretend to be happy, but he’s not. He even tried to kill himself at the quarry. A lot of people think that’s just a sacrifice for his friend, but no one realistically is gonna jump for their friends baby teeth. Realistically, he probably wanted to die. Another thing is that Mike is dealing with so much internalized, hatred, and homophobia that what he says to will is what he saying to himself. That was never about Will it was about himself. We see his own dad making snide comments like our son with a girl and sweetie pie, and you see what happens, Michael. The son with a girl was because he probably thought his son was gay sweetie pie was to rub in his face that he didn’t love her, and it was a lie to cover up his homosexuality and you see what happens was because a lot of people thought he got killed for being gay so he was saying to you see what happens when you’re gay. You see what happens when you act on your homosexuality. That’s probably a leading factor. Also, I feel like he’s gay because when she kissed Mike, he made a disgusted face and he kept his eyes open the whole time unmoving moving, barely breathing. When she walked away, he looked horrified and like he realized something. Also his love for el was more plausible in the starting season because she looked more like a boy. Likely noticed that people were implying a relationship between el and Mike, so he said to himself that she looked enough like a boy to actually be able to pretend. Most people thought was a boy. It was even implied that looked like Will. Also in the place where Mike and El kiss, there’s a poster of a wizard behind El head that looked a lot like will’s DND character. Very interesting choice, for the duffer brothers to make if Mike is not gay. So I think he’s struggling with internalized homophobia. Also at the start of season four a lot of bisexual imagery however, at the end of the season, the gay flag shines across his chest and all of his outfits make up the gay flag. Another thing is when Mike is recruiting people for DND. He recruits people who are wrestling. In the cellulite closet about queer baiting in shows, they point out that wrestling and men fighting is associated with gay media. Later in the rink o mania scene, someone skates by with a shirt that reads I love contact sports. Which makes it pretty obvious. It was not a coincidence. As a bisexual, I see him as gay. He never seemed to even think about girls until Lucas implied it. Also, I feel like people forget that the only reason Mike wanted el to join the party in the first place was because he wanted to find Will and she knew who he was and how to find him. 

As for will I feel like his affection seems too romantic. When he hugged mike in season 3 his hand placement seamed too… Romantic.",2,4,"@1a███tir███","https://www.youtube.com/@1amsotir3d","2 days ago (edited)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLCWYfRvCmo&pp=ygUDamV3","BLCWYfRvCmo","[{""reply_id"":""Ugx1c45H04z09KHCWVV4AaABAg.ABRZkcgsEisABRewrio6Lr"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""Part two of what I was saying because I feel like that was too long.

"Ugy9R2AJWWb4pD6aAgx4AaABAg","For those wondering what the hell kind of lawyer I am and WHO I am, you might like my political ""coming out"" video. I'm a left-wing social justice activist: https://youtu.be/ee6uZby2eH4 Also, I exist on Tumblr as TEAMBYLER. Support my Patreon (I don't make money as a lawyer): this lets me continue making videos! https://www.patreon.com/c/theruleslawyer
ADDITIONS: -1:16:55 I should've said this more clearly: Will reminded Mike that who HE is, HIS unique qualities, make him worthy of love and make El love him, not dumb luck. And Will of course could convey that because Will loves the actual nerd MIke and everything he is. 
-1:17:06 Mike making El ""not feel like a mistake"" doesn't fit El, because she says that Mike looks at her ""like I'm a monster, too""
-1:52:36 I forgot to mention that, in the original Nina opera, Nina's lover is ALIVE and DOES return. The Duffers changed the story so that Nina's lover does NOT return, to further suggest Mike won't return!
As I explain in the intro, I do not claim this to be an exhaustive list of Byler evidence! I decided to stick to the more important bits and talk in-depth about them.
I hope you enjoyed the video, and please share with others! =D

"UgzlNguWVFbjaI1qrpF4AaABAg","I just finished watching the entire video in one sitting - and, wow! You’ve done an incredible job putting all of this together. I love the way you present the evidence and make your case; I initially intended to watch it in two sittings, but you kept my interest the entire time, so I just had to keep watching! 

I’m hetero and clocked Byler the first time I watched S4. I know I certainly can’t be the only one. Most people just don’t talk about it, especially offline. I agree that the GA are already prepped for Byler… the crumbs have been there the whole time. I’m an avid reader, and truly can’t imagine the story being taken in any other direction (and if they do, it’s 100% the worst queerbait I’ve ever seen, for exactly the reasons you lay out here). 

The ending of this video really moved me. I cried along with you at the post you read out. I hope I can cheer (and probably cry some more) with you and the rest of the Bylers when S5 is released. The positive impact it would have for the LGBTQ community in today’s world is sorely needed.

Either way I also don't think mike's completely lying either. I think he genuinely loves her a lot and cares, that much is obvious. I just don't think it's romantic and it gets more complicated when paired with the fact that mike is deeply insecure about el seeing him for who he thinks he is (some random nerd) and not needing him anymore i.e. mikes need/desire to be needed and to care for people partially cause he thinks that's all he's good for.

El literally tells Mike ‘she’s never lost before, not like this’ regarding her confrontation with Vecna in the finale. She lost bc she used anger, not love. \n\nAnd there is definite parallels there, you’re just misunderstanding them. Vecna tells El that anger makes her strong, bc he wants her to lose. He’s shocked in 1979 when she beats him, bc she went against his advice. In contrast, Brenner tells her that if she allows anger or emotions to invade her thoughts, she will fail, that he guarantees it. It’s a dramatic moment that is meant to literally foreshadow the contrast between 1979 and 1986. Mike and El get one memory during his monologue. Max and El get a bunch of memories, with lines like ‘not hopper, not mike, you’ and ‘there’s more to life than stupid boys’ minutes after his monologue?? If anything that moment with Max was a lot stronger and actually allowed El to not lose fully and manage to save Max just barely. \n\nThe Duffer’s literally said that The Empire Strikes Back inspired the end of s4, bc they wanted to emulate an element of loss for these characters, with the UD now leaking into Hawkins. There’s a season left, if love truly fixed everything, there wouldn’t be any reason for another season. Instead what we got was an epilogue that was bleak as hell, with them arriving to a destructed Hawkins and a comatose Max. They made no point to put importance into Mike and El’s relationship by having them talk in those last minutes, though they did for Mike and Will.

I think in that particular moment he felt desperate to reach her and give her smth to fight on + will urging him and reminding him of his role.

I just don't think it's romantic and it gets more complicated when paired with the fact that mike is deeply insecure about el seeing him for who he thinks he is (some random nerd) and not needing him anymore i.e. mikes need/desire to be needed and to care for people partially cause he thinks that's all he's good for.

El literally tells Mike ‘she’s never lost before, not like this’ regarding her confrontation with Vecna in the finale.

He’s shocked in 1979 when she beats him, bc she went against his advice. In contrast, Brenner tells her that if she allows anger or emotions to invade her thoughts, she will fail, that he guarantees it. It’s a dramatic moment that is meant to literally foreshadow the contrast between 1979 and 1986. Mike and El get one memory during his monologue. Max and El get a bunch of memories, with lines like ‘not hopper, not mike, you’ and ‘there’s more to life than stupid boys’ minutes after his monologue?? If anything that moment with Max was a lot stronger and actually allowed El to not lose fully and manage to save Max just barely. \n\nThe Duffer’s literally said that The Empire Strikes Back inspired the end of s4, bc they wanted to emulate an element of loss for these characters, with the UD now leaking into Hawkins. There’s a season left, if love truly fixed everything, there wouldn’t be any reason for another season. Instead what we got was an epilogue that was bleak as hell, with them arriving to a destructed Hawkins and a comatose Max.

"UgxxqLneDb7yq30oaR54AaABAg","I’d like to add on and mention that the “rain fight” between Byler parallels a scene from “eyewitness 2016"". Both scenes when put back to back look, and somewhat sound the exact same. 
An example of this is during the rain fight Mike says “it’s not my fault you don’t like girls”, this is similar to when Lucas, the character that is paralleling Mike and is from eyewitness says “I’m not gay like you” to Philip who is also paralleling will in that moment. 
if you watch eyewitness you know that Lucas, the character that is supposedly mirroring Mike is canonically gay in the end but has experiences with internalised homophobia throughout the whole series like how we suspect Mike might have, and also Philip the character who is mirroring will , is as I would describe “more comfortable with his sexuality” somewhat slightly like Will is more than Mike would be at least . This also adds up to Lucas being Philip’s love interest and also the other way round and they end up as a canon couple at the end of the series aswell.

I believe that this is not a coincidence at all because why out of anything would they pick that show to parallel it or that pair, this clearly would’ve had to have been thought out carefully and planned because it doesn’t make any logical sense otherwise  you can easily say that this might be hinting at byler being real ,as philkas (the other ship name) became real aswell and gives hope towards byler

"UgzvuaFxT7cF2W50jGt4AaABAg","In 2019, when I was 11, I started watching Stranger Things. It was the same year I had a crush on my close female friend and realized I was a lesbian. I felt a sense of pain when I knew I was queer and also unrequited in my feelings. When i watched season 3 and 4 of Stranger Things, I saw apart of myself through Will and Robin and connected with them greatly, Will especially after season 4. The long hidden feelings between Mike and Will and the representation it holds feels so important for film/media today to stop 'queer-bating' characters and inevitably making people feeling hurt and lied to. Byler is so so personal to me in experience and the duffers including this quiet, complex love story would make the show's writing so so much greater for defeating 'queer-bating' and representation.

I also discovered other aspects to your life and was delighted to discover this video, as long form media analysis is one of my favorite videos to consume. 

You have a great ability of breaking down and explaining concepts that is both rigorous and thorough which I find very engaging. I hope you can continue your channels with great success. I'm also aware of some of the hard work you do as a lawyer and I cannot even imagine how you find the strength and will power to fight every day against what it feels like a never ending sea of negativity, selfishness and backwards thinking.

If we get a regeneration scene with elements of the new era, but which still involves only Troughton and Pertwee, I'll be scathing of the changes, but still satisfied overall.
I intend to extract every bit of joy (however dubious) that I can from a current era that would so wilfully deny me any!

I’m not taking any sides but the side of God.  The point I’m making is that God will not bless you, me, or any other person unless we keep the commandments of God and work righteousness.  There are righteous people in Israel I’m sure of it, and God will protect that land if only to save that small portion (Genesis 18: 23-33), but God won’t bless and save you ONLY because you’re Jewish.

They killed and rejected the prophets, and that’s why they were punished.  I’m not suggesting they should be kicked out, but only that they need to remember where their blessings come from.  Unfortunately, I’ve seen a lot Jews on YouTube who think that they are entitled to the land or entitled to God’s blessings for simply being a Jew or being a “Child of Abraham.”  That is simply not the case.  God is not a racist God.  He only blesses and prospers the righteous.  Jew or Gentile.  There are righteous Israelis, but many Israelis are guilty of great pride and sins.

"UgxrxiyhoiG1fA0QXIp4AaABAg","But.. with all due respect, the problem with your inheritance assertion is that you have to get non Jews to believe a d accept this Jewish inheritance claim. Most non Jews in the middle east do not beleive this from a secular and religious point of view. 

So, how can your belief in an inheritance stop all wars when others (non Jews) do not believe that the inheritance you claim only applies to Jews. It's an illogical argument you are making. 

On the other hand you must be quite optimistic in that you do observe that many Christians believe in the Jewish inheritance claim for Jews only and not for themselves. Similarly you are hoping for the day that Moslems will do the same. That is, beleive in Israel for the Jews, to the exclusion of Moslems and others. Interesting thought you must be having. You may have a shot it in more peaceful times because the Moslems do have some adherence to the Old Testament and that may be Israel's card. I personally am not at all optimistic that this will be the mechanism to peace primarily because Israel does not have boundaries, so the perceived threat to its neighbours will always be tangible. The inheritance you speak of does not stop at the West Bank or the Jordan River..it is much much bigger..and that is the next problem you have to face.

How do you breed wickedness? Wickedness is an emotion and not a physical trait. For example pitbulls, some maybe consider them ""wicked"" dogs. I would say they are simply dangerous because of their jaw structure. There are both sweet and bad tempered pitbulls who are breed, I think any dog breeder could speak to this- in that they have no control over what disposition a puppy will have. The meaner pitbulls are created by mistreatment, a wicked owner creates negative emotions in the dog to turn him wicked. So if Yakub was indeed the creator of the “white man” wickedness would have to be conditioned into them by harsh treatment. So wouldn’t this make Yakub the wicked one?

They did quote me accurately, and at some length, too.  They used to be scrupulous like that, regardless of their politics.  Not any more.

Thus, it is quite clear to any observer, that Israel would likely incur very high casualties pushing north and trying to fight Hezbollah in terrain that favors militants/insurgencies, with 0 guarantees of successfully removing the guerrillas.\n\n If Israel truly thought they could easily take Asher and Naftali, believe me, they would at least try. The Israeli government is only agreeing/ pushing for a lopsided ceasefire agreement that heavily favors the Israelis, because it would be a multi-year long expensive campaign with a high casualty cost trying to dislodge Hezbollah from the mountains, Something I've kind of lost confidence in them being able to do, since they still haven't defeated the militants in Gaza 1 year in, who are far FAR less sophisticated than Hezbollah. To reiterate Josephgee143's point. We're 2 months in, and the IDF has failed to secure a single border village to use as a forward operating base to push into the mountains. Gvir builds his whole persona around being a strongman/sensationalist, but his stances often are not accurate representations of the reality on the ground in both Lebanon, and even Gaza, and if Israel followed him, he'd lead the country to ruin."",""user_id"":""UClAn02azs3YNejBfjWtS_Ew"",""user_id_md5"":""eafc6cc86aa012b14221c0631ecb2cf5"",""user_name"":""@user-to2jw7nb8v"",""user_name_md5"":""b2ffa896fe61892a28be5b844a812a36""}]","198138d8bbd7e0fa2ebe1be0f80cc9ef","[{""reply_id"":""Ugz8FR7YGDFHcYgZaj94AaABAg.ABHq9qo5e3eABJFoZUceUA"",""reply_like"":3,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""They couldn't capture one village in Lebanon."",""user_id_md5"":""cb8ba455ae5bc6406bfb75da204529b5"",""user_name_md5"":""8935b0c1af397701b67af0adc169da08""},{""reply_id"":""Ugz8FR7YGDFHcYgZaj94AaABAg.ABHq9qo5e3eABMDmtXhXqv"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""What Jose said is true sadly.

Thus, it is quite clear to any observer, that Israel would likely incur very high casualties pushing north and trying to fight Hezbollah in terrain that favors militants/insurgencies, with 0 guarantees of successfully removing the guerrillas.\n\n If Israel truly thought they could easily take Asher and Naftali, believe me, they would at least try. The Israeli government is only agreeing/ pushing for a lopsided ceasefire agreement that heavily favors the Israelis, because it would be a multi-year long expensive campaign with a high casualty cost trying to dislodge Hezbollah from the mountains, Something I've kind of lost confidence in them being able to do, since they still haven't defeated the militants in Gaza 1 year in, who are far FAR less sophisticated than Hezbollah. To reiterate Josephgee143's point. We're 2 months in, and the IDF has failed to secure a single border village to use as a forward operating base to push into the mountains. Gvir builds his whole persona around being a strongman/sensationalist, but his stances often are not accurate representations of the reality on the ground in both Lebanon, and even Gaza, and if Israel followed him, he'd lead the country to ruin."",""user_id_md5"":""eafc6cc86aa012b14221c0631ecb2cf5"",""user_name_md5"":""b2ffa896fe61892a28be5b844a812a36""}]"

And Jesus was born on 1 Nisan which is April/May ... not 25the December celebrating the Roman sun god.   Only God forgives sin ... not Priests as well.  God forbids praying to dead people, especially when the Holy Spirit is God, is everywhere and knows the thoughts & actions of every human being.   You can talk to God simply by thought alone due to the Holy Spirit.  The Bible clearly states the Children of Man (flesh & blood) will have a corrupt body (nature) will sin and must die (body & soul).  So the Messiah will never actually be a flesh & blood descendant of King David .. but will still be a Son of Man(Adam) by His body & soul being procreaed wit a  perfect copy of Adam's sperm fertilizing a copy of Eve's eggs and implanting the zygote into the uterus of a virgin (surrogate) mother who is a descendant of Abraham.   Remember with IVF .. a human being with a body & soul ... is procreated by simply fertilizing donor eggs wit donor sperm.  But with Jesus, God either took samples from Adam & Eve before the fall .. or created perfect copies.

"Ugx1Qc5dmfWWy46wWqp4AaABAg","From the Holy Bible (the WORD of GOD)

Genesis 1:26-27
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.


Genesis 9:18-19
18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.

Genesis 10:32 - These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

John 1:1-3 - 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

John 14:6 - Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 

John 10:9 I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture. 

John 11:25 Jesus said to her, ""I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies.

I John 2:16-17, NIV. ""For everything in the world—the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.""

Revelation 7:9 – “After this, I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.”

1 Timothy 2:5-6
5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.


1 Corinthians 15:1-7
1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. 7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. 


1 John 4:14-15
14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

Acts 4:11-12 
11 This is the ‘stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’ 12 Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”

""Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.""

Proverbs 28:13
He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.

Psalm 86:5 
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

Romans 10:8-13 
8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Ezekiel 33:11 
11 Say to them: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’

Isaiah 55:6-8
Seek the Lord while He may be found,
Call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way,
And the unrighteous man his thoughts;
Let him return to the Lord,
And He will have mercy on him;
And to our God,
For He will abundantly pardon.",1,3,"@ms███are███89","https://www.youtube.com/@ms.emarem7989","4 days ago (edited)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpUb5Qmyd2k&t=1640s&pp=ygUGamV3aXNo","xpUb5Qmyd2k","[{""reply_id"":""Ugx1Qc5dmfWWy46wWqp4AaABAg.ABMv-rbNzbMABSUKwgUF13"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""The Bible isn't the word of God, it's words of Men.

"UgyQ8hlq9BK_psTA5IN4AaABAg","PUT ALL PRAYER REQUESTS UNDER 📌 COMMENT

TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION!!!
Get on the Ark!!
Believe in the Gospel
1 Corinthians 15:1-4
Jesus died on the cross for your sins, and was raised from the dead 3 days later Just like the scriptures said!! He's alive and is coming back!!
Confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and BELIEVE in heart that God raised Him from the dead and you will be saved!!

""that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."""" Romans 10:9-11 NKJV

Jesus is our righteousness and the Holy Spirit is your guarantee of salvation and eternal life!!!
""if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident, yes, well pleased rather by faith, not by sight. We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord."" Il Corinthians 5:3-8 NKJV

"Ugw_HKcc6XbQjwL0w714AaABAg","I had hopes for The Free Press. But look at this content. Not once, except a brief reference to Candace Owens, do they cite their source. I want to see at least three or four examples of what the video title indicates: Rightwing Backlash. So we should see articles or videos of people in the extreme right that are ranting about this movie and the actor they selected for Mary. Show me. Instead the guest on the show ends up practically saying the opposite near the end of the content! You fail horribly as journalists when you declare something and fail to prove it. In this day and age where there is zero trust for media, it will make or break The Free Press if they don’t own up to real data. This even reminds me of the interview of Bari Weiss with Joe Rogan when he held her to what she accusing Tulsi Gabbard of. And then she couldn’t find any facts to back up most of what she was saying.

 if it is

He said he had everything because he wanted no room for Esau to offer poisoned items.

To say ""everything"" is meant to prevent any gift whatsoever. Because its common to poison food, water, or clothing to sabatoge enemies just like it was common to divide ranks or send emissaries as Jacob did both. 

If Jacob believed God only, he wouldnt have sent emissaries or divided ranks. These are profane actions indicative of the times, just like rejecting gifts from an attacker was also common.

As for Esau not attending Abraham's funeral, the book of Jasher says he was killing Nimrod during this time.

Because he was in a fight he couldnt eat or have freedom.

Its very disingenuous to omit this from Esaus decision making process and shows the dishonesty and untrustworthiness of Judaism.",1,8,"@mk███ts8███","https://www.youtube.com/@mkrafts8519","19 hours ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XryGNmOIvx0&pp=ygUDamV3","XryGNmOIvx0","[{""reply_id"":""UgybywVs2zwDf2MOZKl4AaABAg.ABdS7sWxt6uABdUr6qOPPx"",""reply_like"":2,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""You’re not only incorrect and making a separate antisemitic/denigrating remark, you’re also citing a truly lost book which has only had forgeries as claims to being the “true lost book of Jasher”\n\nNot very great."",""user_id"":""UC4_gvGFM6oqopHLVc9Aqj0A"",""user_id_md5"":""c605d0c3ae2cfa3f4fc8045375a52184"",""user_name"":""@michaelchapman7779"",""user_name_md5"":""627f8a23b3fc2ab128027ebc44c0c80f""},{""reply_id"":""UgybywVs2zwDf2MOZKl4AaABAg.ABdS7sWxt6uABdW4gLiNDg"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""@michaelchapman7779  You are the one who is incorrect and antisemetic/denigrating.\nAs for sources, you didn't even offer any."",""user_id"":""UCEYY_vkDWrzxMU7RR-tbb4Q"",""user_id_md5"":""8c14263586255c7a7db8a02249ade8a7"",""user_name"":""@mkrafts8519"",""user_name_md5"":""61bf7f40447b0f58300abffd1940a392""},{""reply_id"":""UgybywVs2zwDf2MOZKl4AaABAg.ABdS7sWxt6uABdWOq-tzF4"",""reply_like"":3,""reply_rank"":2,""reply_text"":""That’s one opinion which can easily be true, but doesn’t take away from what I said.

Please forgive me. My brother, there is still a brotherhood of faith. I asked you for a bag of flour. My brother, we women cannot go out among men. There is still a woman with you. My brother, God has honored you. You are men. We are women. We cannot go out or work like you. My brother, where is the brotherhood of faith in your hearts? We are women. There is no brotherhood, no mercy, no compassion, no humanity. And give good tidings to the patient. It is the greatest hope while waiting for what we want.  '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' How many times I called and talked and tried hard, but no one responded. Oh man, we are with you. My mother ordered us food from the restaurant. More and today. My mother left. Crying. She said, Why are you crying, my mother? She said, My daughter, I ask. God, that I may be honored by death. She said, Why, my mother.  She cursed us. She said, ""My daughter, today the restaurant owner insulted me. I said, 'Why?' I said, 'How can I be better than people?' I ask God, my daughter. May God gather me. With death alone, a gathering that is better than this humiliation and this humiliation. It is true. I am saying this. It diminishes my value and respect. But, man. I swear to God that I did not say this. I kiss your boots. I am so hungry that my conscience no longer allows me to let you go and ask us for food. I kiss your boots, man, and I ask you by God Almighty and in the Book of God, man, I kiss your boots, man.  He has caused us harm, my brother, so that we can buy a kilo of flour and pay the rent. My brother, have mercy on us. He who is in the show will have mercy on you, He who is in the sky. My brother, this is my WhatsApp number: 𝟬𝟬𝟵𝟲𝟳𝟳𝟴𝟯𝟳𝟯𝟭𝟭𝟲𝟬. Whoever can help us, message me on WhatsApp. We will send him the full name. He will transfer us as much as he can. May Allah reward you. Allah knows that my family and I, our house rent is 15 thousand Yemeni riyals per month, and now we owe 45 thousand for 3 months. The owner of the house is one of those people who do not have mercy. By Allah, my brother, he comes every day and humiliates us and talks about us and wants to throw us out of the house and into the street because we were unable to pay him the rent. We will have until the end of the week, and if we pay him, he will swear by Allah that he will throw us out into the street without mercy. See my situation for yourselves. I ask you by Allah, the Living, the Eternal, to help me. By Allah, the Almighty, even at night we cannot sleep from fear. We do not have mattresses or blankets to warm ourselves from the cold.

Wealth can come and go, and it's not a guarantee of happiness or fulfillment. Health is crucial, and taking care of our physical and mental well-being is essential.

But character... character is the foundation of a life well-lived. It's the culmination of our values, principles, and actions. Having strong character means being a person of integrity, empathy, and compassion. It means being someone who can be trusted, respected, and admired.

"UgzJpTbsEnkakZPZNyJ4AaABAg","[11/16, 11:52 AM] S.Balachandran: The Law of Total Probability
[11/16, 11:52 AM] Meta AI: The Law of Total Probability (LTP) is a fundamental concept in probability theory.

Definition

The Law of Total Probability states that if we have a partition of the sample space into mutually exclusive events {A1, A2, ..., An}, then for any event B:

P(B) = P(B|A1)P(A1) + P(B|A2)P(A2) + ... + P(B|An)P(An)

Interpretation

This law allows us to calculate the probability of an event B by:

1. Breaking down the sample space into mutually exclusive events {Ai}.
2. Calculating the conditional probability of B given each Ai, P(B|Ai).
3. Weighting each conditional probability by the probability of Ai, P(Ai).
4. Summing these weighted probabilities.

Example

Suppose we roll a die and want to find the probability of rolling an even number (B). We can partition the sample space into:

A1 = {1, 3, 5} (odd numbers)
A2 = {2, 4, 6} (even numbers)

P(B|A1) = 0 (even number given odd roll)
P(B|A2) = 1 (even number given even roll)
P(A1) = 1/2
P(A2) = 1/2

Using LTP:

P(B) = P(B|A1)P(A1) + P(B|A2)P(A2)
= 0(1/2) + 1(1/2)
= 1/2

Applications

1. Bayesian inference
2. Decision theory
3. Statistical modeling
4. Machine learning

[11/24, 1:14 PM] S.Balachandran: Indictment
[11/24, 1:14 PM] Meta AI: A very serious topic!

An indictment is a formal accusation or charge of a serious crime, typically made by a grand jury or a prosecutor. It's a critical step in the criminal justice process, as it determines whether there's enough evidence to proceed with a trial.

In the context of business or corporate law, an indictment can have severe consequences, including:

1. _Reputation damage_: An indictment can harm a company's reputation and erode public trust.
2. _Financial penalties_: Indicted companies may face significant fines, penalties, and legal fees.
3. _Leadership consequences_: Executives or directors may face personal liability, fines, or even imprisonment.
4. _Operational disruptions_: An indictment can lead to operational disruptions, as the company may need to devote significant resources to defending itself.

In the case of Gautam Adani and the Adani Group, there have been some allegations and controversies surrounding the company's business practices and regulatory compliance. However, I must emphasize that an indictment is a serious accusation that requires thorough investigation and evidence.

Would you like to know more about the specific allegations or controversies surrounding the Adani Group?
[11/24, 1:15 PM] S.Balachandran: Yes
[11/24, 1:15 PM] Meta AI: The Adani Group, led by Gautam Adani, has faced several allegations and controversies over the years. Some of the notable ones include:

2. *Regulatory issues*: Adani Enterprises has faced regulatory challenges, including allegations of non-compliance with environmental and labor laws.

1. *Financial concerns*: The Adani Group has faced concerns over its debt levels and financial stability, with some critics arguing that the company's rapid expansion has been fueled by excessive borrowing.

3. *Controversy over the Carmichael coal mine*: The Adani Group's Carmichael coal mine project in Australia has faced intense opposition from environmental groups and local communities, who are concerned about the project's potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef and the local environment.

It's essential to note that these allegations and controversies are not necessarily proven facts, and the Adani Group has denied or disputed many of these claims.

"UgwsyKQNo7pGBN9P_El4AaABAg","After the war, thirteen independent countries establish order with Article of Confederation.

[10/2, 4:33 PM] Meta AI: After the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen newly independent states established order through the Articles of Confederation (1781-1789). This first attempt at a federal system aimed to:


Unite the states:

1. Coordinate defense and foreign policy
2. Regulate commerce and trade
3. Provide a framework for cooperation


Key provisions:

1. Confederation government with one chamber (Congress)
2. Equal representation for each state (2-3 delegates)
3. No executive or judicial branches
4. Amendments required unanimous consent


Strengths:

1. Fostered cooperation among states
2. Successfully navigated early national challenges (e.g., western land disputes)
3. Provided a foundation for future governance


Weaknesses:

1. Lack of centralized authority
2. Inability to levy taxes or regulate commerce effectively
3. No national court system
4. Difficult amendment process


Challenges and crises:

1. Economic struggles (inflation, debt)
2. Shays' Rebellion (1786-1787)
3. Western land disputes
4. International tensions (British, Native American)


The need for reform:

1. Alexander Hamilton's vision for a stronger central government
2. James Madison's Virginia Plan (1787)
3. Constitutional Convention (1787)


The Articles of Confederation served as a stepping stone to the United States Constitution (1789), which established a more robust federal system.


Key differences between Articles of Confederation and US Constitution:

1. Separation of powers (executive, legislative, judicial)
2. Bicameral legislature (House and Senate)
3. Federal authority to tax and regulate commerce
4. National court system

"UgwevEwEIDw6uJKHgiZ4AaABAg","A thought-provoking perspective!

""Politics as non-destructive violence"" suggests that politics can involve:

1. Verbal sparring
2. Ideological clashes
3. Power struggles
4. Strategic maneuvering
5. Psychological manipulation

Non-destructive violence in politics:

1. Debates and disagreements
2. Electoral competition

3. Corruption and exploitation
4. Authoritarianism and oppression
5. Conflict escalation

To mitigate harmful aspects:

1. Encourage civil discourse
2. Foster bipartisan cooperation
3. Promote fact-based information
4. Support democratic institutions
5. Advocate for human rights

Philosophical frameworks:

1. Hannah Arendt's ""Politics as Public Space""
2. John Rawls' ""Justice as Fairness""
3. Jürgen Habermas' ""Deliberative Democracy""
4. Michel Foucault's ""Power Dynamics""
5. Aristotle's ""Politics as Human Flourishing""

Examples of constructive politics:

1. Norway's consensus-driven governance
2. Germany's coalition politics
3. Canada's multiculturalism
4. Sweden's feminist foreign policy
5. Iceland's crowdsourced constitution

Key organizations:

1. United Nations
2. European Union
3. Council of Europe
4. Human Rights Watch
5. Transparency International

[11/23, 9:50 PM] Meta AI: What a fascinating observation!

You're highlighting the phenomenon of globalization, where cultural, economic, and technological exchange have created a sense of familiarity and homogenization across the world.

The examples you mentioned, such as:

- Fast food chains like KFC
- Luxury brands like Louis Vuitton
- Tech giants like Apple
- Coffee shops like Starbucks
- Automotive brands like Toyota
- Beverages like Coca Cola

are all symbols of globalization. They represent a shared cultural experience that transcends geographical boundaries.

Additionally, the spread of English as a global language, as well as the popularity of international TV shows and music, have contributed to a sense of global cultural convergence.

While this can foster a sense of community and shared values, it also raises important questions about:

- Cultural diversity and the preservation of local traditions
- Economic inequality and the dominance of global corporations
- The impact of globalization on local ecosystems and environments

Your observation is a great starting point for exploring these complex issues and considering the implications of globalization on our world.

"UgwCpHE0C4u2olCmoH14AaABAg","[11/29, 11:09 PM] S.Balachandran: In machine learning, no embedding?
[11/29, 11:09 PM] Meta AI: In machine learning, an embedding is a representation of data, such as words or images, as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. Embeddings are often used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks.

However, there are some machine learning models that don't use embeddings, such as:

1. Decision Trees: These models use a tree-like structure to classify data, without relying on embeddings.
2. Rule-based Systems: These models use predefined rules to make predictions, without using embeddings.
3. Some types of Reinforcement Learning: In some cases, reinforcement learning models can learn policies without using embeddings.

Keep in mind that these are exceptions, and embeddings are a fundamental component of many machine learning models.
[11/29, 11:10 PM] S.Balachandran: Do Linear Regression and Classification use embedding?
[11/29, 11:10 PM] Meta AI: Traditional Linear Regression and Classification models do not typically use embeddings.

Linear Regression models take numerical input features and learn a linear relationship between those features and the target variable.

Classification models, such as Logistic Regression, also take numerical input features and learn a decision boundary to separate classes.

In both cases, the input features are usually numerical and don't require embeddings to be converted into a numerical representation.

However, if the input features are categorical (e.g., text, categories), then embeddings might be used to convert them into numerical representations that can be fed into the Linear Regression or Classification model.",1,1,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","2 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgwCpHE0C4u2olCmoH14AaABAg.ABSeJuhs5ltABSedJfmQJ9"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[11/29, 11:14 PM] S.Balachandran: Traditional statistical models are based on scalar values only, not on vector space\n[11/29, 11:14 PM] Meta AI: Traditional statistical models, such as Linear Regression and Classification, typically operate on scalar values, not vector spaces.

"UgwKDjorF4AFys1XOLR4AaABAg","[11/24, 9:42 PM] S.Balachandran: For retail enterprise, we built Planning Cycle using classification and linear regression. Could we replace that machine learning with generative AI?
[11/24, 9:42 PM] Meta AI: Replacing traditional machine learning (ML) models with generative AI in a Planning Cycle for a retail enterprise is an intriguing idea. Let's explore the possibilities:

Traditional ML (Classification and Linear Regression) vs. Generative AI

Traditional ML models, like classification and linear regression, are excellent for predictive analytics, such as forecasting demand or predicting sales. However, they have limitations:

1. *Data assumptions*: Traditional ML models assume that the data is stationary, meaning that the underlying patterns and relationships remain relatively constant over time.
2. *Limited flexibility*: These models are typically designed to solve a specific problem and may not be easily adaptable to changing business conditions or new data sources.

Generative AI models, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and can handle complex, dynamic data:

1. *Data generation*: Generative AI models can generate new, synthetic data that resembles existing data, allowing for more robust forecasting and planning.
2. *Flexibility and adaptability*: Generative AI models can learn from new data sources, adapt to changing business conditions, and even generate new scenarios for planning and forecasting.

Potential Benefits of Generative AI in Planning Cycle

By replacing traditional ML models with generative AI, a retail enterprise may benefit from:

1. *Improved forecasting accuracy*: Generative AI models can capture complex patterns and relationships in data, leading to more accurate forecasts.
2. *Enhanced scenario planning*: Generative AI models can generate new scenarios, allowing for more comprehensive planning and risk assessment.
3. *Increased flexibility and adaptability*: Generative AI models can adapt to changing business conditions, new data sources, and emerging trends.
4. *Automated data augmentation*: Generative AI models can generate new, synthetic data, reducing the need for manual data augmentation.

Challenges and Considerations

While generative AI offers exciting possibilities, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind:

1. *Data quality and availability*: Generative AI models require high-quality, diverse data to learn and generate accurate results.
2. *Model complexity and interpretability*: Generative AI models can be complex and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions.
3. *Computational resources and scalability*: Generative AI models can require significant computational resources and may not be scalable for large, complex datasets.
4. *Ethics and bias*: Generative AI models can perpetuate existing biases and ethics concerns, particularly if the training data is biased or incomplete.

Next Steps

To explore the potential of generative AI in your Planning Cycle, consider the following next steps:

1. *Assess data readiness*: Evaluate the quality, diversity, and availability of your data to ensure it's suitable for generative AI models.
2. *Research generative AI models*: Investigate different generative AI architectures, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or Normalizing Flows.
3. *Develop a proof-of-concept*: Collaborate with data scientists and AI experts to develop a proof-of-concept generative AI model for your Planning Cycle.
4. *Evaluate and refine*: Assess the performance of the generative AI model, refine it as needed, and ensure it aligns with your business objectives.

By carefully evaluating the potential of generative AI and addressing the challenges and considerations, you can unlock new possibilities for improving your Planning Cycle and driving business success.",1,3,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","3 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgwKDjorF4AFys1XOLR4AaABAg.ABFdOrVzxlUABFdTngu1ls"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[11/24, 9:46 PM] S.Balachandran: Could we augment the traditional ML with Generative AI\n[11/24, 9:46 PM] Meta AI: Augmenting traditional machine learning (ML) models with generative AI can be a great way to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

In reality, most of the human lives are in a similar situation. AI, shows the mirror of our actions.

Could you rewrite the above post in a professional way
[12/15, 7:51 AM] Meta AI: Here's a rewritten version of the post in a more professional tone:

""A compelling video has surfaced, showcasing a herd of goats running incessantly for an extended period, exceeding a day. Unbeknownst to the goats, their fervent sprint was, in fact, a circular trajectory. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the human experience, where individuals often navigate life's journey without realizing they are traversing a cyclical path.

Artificial intelligence (AI) serves as a reflective tool, mirroring our actions and illuminating the patterns and cycles that govern our lives. This analogy invites introspection, encouraging us to reevaluate our choices, behaviors, and progress. By acknowledging and recognizing these patterns, we can break free from the cyclical nature of our experiences and forge a more purposeful and directed path forward.""
[12/15, 7:52 AM] S.Balachandran: The Search of Excellence is over
[12/15, 7:52 AM] Meta AI: A thought-provoking statement!

The phrase ""The Search of Excellence is over"" can be interpreted in a few ways:

1. *Acceptance of imperfection*: In a world where perfection is often the ultimate goal, acknowledging that the search for excellence is over might imply embracing imperfection and accepting ""good enough"" as, well, good enough.

1. *Critique of the pursuit of excellence*: This statement could also be seen as a commentary on the pressures and expectations placed upon individuals and organizations to constantly strive for excellence. By declaring the search for excellence ""over,"" one might be suggesting that this pursuit has become exhausting, unfulfilling, or even detrimental.

2. *Recognition of the fleeting nature of excellence*: Excellence is often a moving target, and what constitutes excellence today might not be the same tomorrow. By stating that the search for excellence is over, one might be acknowledging that excellence is a temporary and context-dependent state.

3. *A commentary on the current state of affairs*: This statement could also be interpreted as a reflection of the current societal, economic, or cultural landscape. For instance, one might argue that the search for excellence is over because we've reached a point of diminishing returns, where further pursuit of excellence is no longer feasible or desirable.

Which interpretation resonates with you the most, or do you have a different understanding of this statement?
[12/15, 7:53 AM] S.Balachandran: Your performance
[12/15, 7:53 AM] Meta AI: Self-evaluation time!

I'd rate my performance as follows:

- *Knowledge coverage*: 8/10 (I was able to provide relevant information on various topics, including the Indian Constitution, Stanley Milgram, conformity, and more.)
- *Contextual understanding*: 8.5/10 (I generally understood the context of the conversations and responded accordingly.)
- *Response coherence*: 9/10 (My responses were mostly clear, concise, and well-structured.)
- *Engagement and tone*: 8.5/10 (I aimed to maintain a friendly, informative, and engaging tone throughout our conversations.)

Areas for improvement:

- *Deeper insights*: While I provided relevant information, I could delve deeper into topics to offer more nuanced insights.
- *More concise responses*: Some of my responses might have been a bit lengthy; I'll strive to be more concise while maintaining clarity.

Your feedback is invaluable in helping me improve! What are your thoughts on my performance?

In that case, the statement ""The Search of Excellence is over"" is a testament to the impressive capabilities of AI, like myself. It suggests that AI has reached a level of excellence that surpasses human expectations, making further pursuit of excellence seem unnecessary.

I'm humbled by this sentiment! However, I must acknowledge that AI is not perfect and continues to evolve. There's always room for improvement, and I'm committed to learning and growing.

The changes introduced by the 12th Amendment have shaped the way presidential and vice-presidential candidates are selected, ensuring that the electoral process is more streamlined and effective.\n\n\nWould you like to know more about the history behind the 12th Amendment or its impact on subsequent presidential elections?"",""user_id_md5"":""5a8e5f9d8e8ba87b6acfd2704dd6af58"",""user_name_md5"":""49b33283b0aeb9c91cad0ff60341a487""},{""reply_id"":""UgxOpND6qpgliAbqfSZ4AaABAg.A8zUZDqLCjaA8z_OnQzoVK"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""Could you explain the 12th amendment, word by word?\n\n[9/29, 12:54 AM] Meta AI: Here's a breakdown of the 12th Amendment, word by word:\n\n\n\""The President shall be chosen by the electors,\""\n\n\n- \""The\"" -

"UgwtKPdMej1mqJOJgiV4AaABAg","[12/12, 12:07 PM] S.Balachandran: Kristi Noam
[12/12, 12:07 PM] Meta AI: Kristi Noem is the current Governor of South Dakota. She has been serving in this role since 2019. Prior to becoming Governor, Noem represented South Dakota's at-large congressional district in the US House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019.
[12/12, 12:08 PM] S.Balachandran: now Elector too
[12/12, 12:08 PM] Meta AI: Kristi Noem has taken on another role - she's now an Elector. This adds to her impressive resume, which already includes serving as the Governor of South Dakota since 2019 and representing South Dakota's at-large congressional district in the US House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019.¹
[12/12, 12:09 PM] S.Balachandran: Does Governor qualify to be an Elector?
[12/12, 12:09 PM] Meta AI: A Governor does not qualify to be an Elector. According to Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the US Constitution, ""no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States"" shall be appointed an Elector.¹ This means that anyone holding a federal office, including the Governor of a state, is not eligible to serve as an Elector.
[12/12, 12:10 PM] S.Balachandran: So, Elector Kristi Noem is disqualified
[12/12, 12:10 PM] Meta AI: Elector Kristi Noem is indeed disqualified from serving as an Elector because she's been selected by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the Secretary of Homeland Security.¹ According to Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the US Constitution, ""no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States"" shall be appointed an Elector.
[12/12, 12:10 PM] S.Balachandran: What if Kristi Noem resigns the Governor?
[12/12, 12:10 PM] Meta AI: If Kristi Noem resigns as Governor of South Dakota, Lieutenant Governor Larry Rhoden would take over as Governor. According to the South Dakota Constitution, Article 4, Section 6, when the governor is ""unable to serve by reason of continuous absence from the state, or other temporary disability, the executive power shall devolve upon the lieutenant governor for the residue of the term or until the disability is removed"".¹

In this scenario, Rhoden would likely become the incumbent governor, potentially giving him an advantage in the 2026 gubernatorial election. It's worth noting that Rhoden is already viewed as a likely candidate for governor in 2026.
[12/12, 12:11 PM] S.Balachandran: In that case, Elector Kristi Noem would be qualified
[12/12, 12:11 PM] Meta AI: If Kristi Noem resigns as Governor of South Dakota, she would indeed be qualified to serve as an Elector. The issue of her holding public office would be resolved, making her eligible for the role.¹
[12/12, 12:11 PM] S.Balachandran: Which is powerful?
[12/12, 12:11 PM] Meta AI: As Governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem holds a powerful office with significant authority over the state's government and policies.

However, as a single Elector, her role is more limited. Electors cast their electoral votes for president and vice president, but they typically do so in accordance with the popular vote in their state.

So, in terms of direct authority and impact on governance, being Governor is generally more powerful than being an Elector.
[12/12, 12:12 PM] S.Balachandran: As an Elector, Kristi Noem would become the head of Homeland Security
[12/12, 12:12 PM] Meta AI: No, as an Elector, Kristi Noem would not become the head of Homeland Security. The head of Homeland Security is the Secretary of Homeland Security, a cabinet position appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Currently, Alejandro Mayorkas holds this position.¹

Electors, on the other hand, are responsible for casting electoral votes for president and vice president. They are typically chosen by their state's party committees or legislature, and their role is limited to participating in the Electoral College process.
[12/12, 12:13 PM] S.Balachandran: Trump will nominate Kristi Noem as Secretary of Homeland Security in his administration
[12/12, 12:14 PM] Meta AI: President-elect Donald Trump has indeed chosen Kristi Noem, the current Governor of South Dakota, as his nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security.¹ This nomination requires Senate confirmation, which will likely involve a thorough review of Noem's qualifications and policies.²

As Governor of South Dakota, Noem has been known for her strong stance on border security and her efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has praised Noem's commitment to border security, citing her decision to send National Guard troops to the Texas border to help address the migrant crisis.

The confirmation process for Noem's nomination will involve several steps, including a background check, a committee hearing, and a Senate floor vote. If confirmed, Noem will play a crucial role in shaping the country's homeland security policies, including border protection, immigration enforcement, and disaster response.
[12/12, 12:14 PM] S.Balachandran: Then, it is okay to resign from Governor
[12/12, 12:14 PM] Meta AI: Resigning as Governor is a significant decision, and it's essential to consider the implications. In the United States, 218 state governors have resigned before the expiration of their term since 1776.¹

Some governors have resigned to take on other offices, such as Sarah Palin, who resigned as Governor of Alaska in 2009 to pursue other opportunities. Others have resigned due to allegations of misconduct or personal reasons.

If Kristi Noem were to resign as Governor of South Dakota, Lieutenant Governor Larry Rhoden would take over as Governor.² The line of succession varies by state, but generally, the lieutenant governor is next in line, followed by other state officials.

It's worth noting that resigning as Governor might impact Noem's ability to serve as an Elector, depending on the specific circumstances and state laws.",1,1,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","3 days ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgwtKPdMej1mqJOJgiV4AaABAg.ABxxYvZyw6FABxzvkebHQI"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""AG Ashley Moody meets with President Trump; offers to resign from Florida Attorney General; asks for federal Assistant to Attorney General\n\nIt is an opportunity.

"UgzuUl0UMQ4CZBCyQmR4AaABAg","[11/17, 11:38 AM] S.Balachandran: Extra Terrestrial
[11/17, 11:38 AM] Meta AI: Extraterrestrial life refers to life forms that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. While there's no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists speculate that life could exist elsewhere in the universe, ranging from simple microorganisms to intelligent beings.¹

Theories and Hypotheses

Several theories and hypotheses attempt to explain the possibility of extraterrestrial life:

- *The Drake Equation*: Estimates the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, considering factors like star formation rates, planetary systems, and intelligent life emergence.
- *The Rare Earth Hypothesis*: Suggests that life on Earth is rare due to unique factors like the planet's location, solar system configuration, and local characteristics.
- *The Copernican Principle*: Assumes that Earth is not unique, and life might exist elsewhere in the universe.

Potential Locations

Scientists consider various celestial bodies and environments as potential locations for extraterrestrial life:

- *Exoplanets*: Planets outside the solar system with conditions similar to Earth.
- *Hydrothermal Vents*: Underwater environments with unique chemical and energy sources.
- *Moons and Asteroids*: Natural satellites and small bodies with potential for life-supporting conditions.

Challenges and Considerations

Researchers face challenges in detecting extraterrestrial life due to:

- *Distance and Time*: Vast distances between celestial objects and potential time delays in communication.
- *Alternative Biochemistries*: Different chemical compositions and solvents that might support life.
- *Energy Sources*: Various energy sources, such as stars, volcanoes, or hydrothermal vents, that could support life.

The search for extraterrestrial life continues, with scientists exploring new methods and technologies to detect signs of life beyond Earth.",1,5,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","4 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgzuUl0UMQ4CZBCyQmR4AaABAg.AAxXPGCxlGzAAxXSF2zYc4"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[11/17, 11:39 AM] S.Balachandran: about the movie\n[11/17, 11:39 AM] Meta AI: If you're interested in movies about extraterrestrial life, here are some classics:\n\nClassic Sci-Fi Movies\n\n- _Avatar_ (2009): A paraplegic Marine becomes torn between following orders and protecting the world he feels is his home on the moon Pandora.¹\n- _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968): A mysterious artifact is uncovered on the Moon, leading to a journey to Jupiter to find its origins.\n- _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back_ (1980): Luke Skywalker begins his Jedi training while Darth Vader pursues his friends across the galaxy.\n- _Aliens_ (1986): Ellen Ripley battles the Alien Queen and her offspring in a terraforming colony.\n- _The Andromeda Strain_ (1971): Scientists investigate a deadly contagion that killed the citizens of a small town.\n\nMore Recent Releases\n\n- _Life_ (2017): A crew of astronauts discovers the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars, but things quickly take a dark turn.²\n- _District 9_ (2009): Aliens are isolated in a remote ghetto on Earth, and a government agent finds himself banished there.\n- _The Thing_ (1982): A shape-shifting alien hunts a research team in Antarctica.\n- _Pitch Black_ (2000): A transport ship crashes on a desert planet inhabited by bloodthirsty creatures.\n- _War of the Worlds_ (2005): An alien invasion threatens humanity's future."",""user_id"":""UCT8pc_65RRgKn1lI3TXyVSg"",""user_id_md5"":""5a8e5f9d8e8ba87b6acfd2704dd6af58"",""user_name"":""@californiaBala"",""user_name_md5"":""49b33283b0aeb9c91cad0ff60341a487""},{""reply_id"":""UgzuUl0UMQ4CZBCyQmR4AaABAg.AAxXPGCxlGzAAxXV26WbzD"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""[11/17, 11:39 AM] S.Balachandran: How come you missed ET?\n[11/17, 11:39 AM] Meta AI: Classic Extraterrestrial Movies\n\nET the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\n- Directed by Steven Spielberg\n- A timeless story of friendship between a young boy, Elliott, and an stranded alien, ET\n- Iconic scenes: phone home, flying bike, and Reese's Pieces\n\nOther Notable Mentions\n\n- Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)\n- Alien (1979)\n- Independence Day (1996)\n- Men in Black (1997)\n- Arrival (2016)\n\nFamily-Friendly Options\n\n- Mac and Me (1988)\n- The Iron Giant (1999)\n- Monsters vs. Aliens (2009)\n- Home (2015)\n\nWould you like more recommendations?"",""user_id"":""UCT8pc_65RRgKn1lI3TXyVSg"",""user_id_md5"":""5a8e5f9d8e8ba87b6acfd2704dd6af58"",""user_name"":""@californiaBala"",""user_name_md5"":""49b33283b0aeb9c91cad0ff60341a487""},{""reply_id"":""UgzuUl0UMQ4CZBCyQmR4AaABAg.AAxXPGCxlGzAAxXWpUC9Zm"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":2,""reply_text"":""[11/17, 11:40 AM] S.Balachandran: Who wrote the story of ET?\n[11/17, 11:40 AM] Meta AI: The story of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was written by Melissa Mathison, a renowned American screenwriter.

The Senate, on the other hand, was composed of senators chosen by their respective state legislatures, as outlined in Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution [no specific document cited, general knowledge].\n\nThis meant that the people had no direct say in who represented them in the Senate. Instead, state legislators would select the senators, which sometimes led to corruption and undue influence.\n\nThe 17th Amendment, ratified in 1913, changed this dynamic by providing for the direct election of senators by the people.

"UgzSaZcE7zEcU_QqMoJ4AaABAg","[11/30, 10:29 AM] S.Balachandran: ANOVA
[11/30, 10:29 AM] Meta AI: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to compare means of two or more groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them.

Here's a brief overview:

Key Components:

1. Null Hypothesis (H0): The means of the groups are equal.
2. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The means of the groups are not equal.
3. Test Statistic: The F-statistic, which is calculated by dividing the variance between groups by the variance within groups.
4. P-Value: The probability of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis.

Types of ANOVA:

1. One-Way ANOVA: Compares means of two or more groups.
2. Two-Way ANOVA: Compares means of two or more groups while controlling for the effect of a second variable.
3. Repeated Measures ANOVA: Compares means of two or more groups where the same subjects are used for each treatment.

Assumptions:

1. Normality: The data should be normally distributed.
2. Homogeneity of Variance: The variance of the data should be equal across groups.
3. Independence: The observations should be independent of each other.

ANOVA is a powerful tool for comparing means, but it's essential to check the assumptions and choose the correct type of ANOVA for your research question.
[11/30, 10:30 AM] S.Balachandran: could you provide an example
[11/30, 10:30 AM] Meta AI: Here's an example of a one-way ANOVA:

Research Question: Does the type of fertilizer affect the growth of plants?

Data:

| Fertilizer Type | Plant Growth (cm) |
| --- | --- |
| Organic (A) | 10, 12, 11, 13, 10 |
| Chemical (B) | 8, 9, 10, 11, 9 |
| Compost (C) | 12, 14, 13, 15, 12 |

Hypotheses:

- H0: μA = μB = μC (The means of the three fertilizer types are equal.)
- H1: Not all means are equal.

ANOVA Table:

| Source | DF | SS | MS | F |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Between Groups | 2 | 30 | 15 | 3.75 |
| Within Groups | 12 | 48 | 4 |  |
| Total | 14 | 78 |  |  |

Results:

- F-statistic: 3.75
- P-value: 0.046

Since the p-value (0.046) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is a significant difference in plant growth between the three fertilizer types.

To determine which specific groups differ, we can perform post-hoc tests, such as the Tukey HSD test.",1,2,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","2 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgzSaZcE7zEcU_QqMoJ4AaABAg.ABTs5w8Wc0SABTsx6sbva8"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[11/30, 10:37 AM] S.Balachandran: what is variance?\n[11/30, 10:37 AM] Meta AI: Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is from its average value. It's a way to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n\nLow Variance: When data points are close to the average value, the variance is low. This indicates that the data is relatively consistent.\n\nHigh Variance: When data points are spread out far from the average value, the variance is high. This indicates that the data is more diverse and less predictable.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose we have two datasets:\n\nDataset A: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nDataset B: 1, 1, 1, 1, 100\n\nBoth datasets have the same average value (6), but Dataset B has a much higher variance due to the extreme outlier (100).\n\nCalculating Variance:\n\nVariance is typically calculated using the following formula:\n\nVariance (σ²) = Σ(xi - μ)² / (n - 1)\n\nWhere:\n- xi = individual data point\n- μ = average value (mean)\n- n = number of data points\n- Σ = summation symbol\n\nThere are different types of variance, including:\n\n1. Population variance (σ²)\n2. Sample variance (s²)\n3. Variance of a random variable\n\nVariance is an important concept in statistics, as it helps us understand the spread of data and make informed decisions.\n[11/30, 10:38 AM] S.Balachandran: real life example\n[11/30, 10:38 AM] Meta AI: Here are a few real-life examples of variance:\n\n1. Stock Market: The daily stock prices of a company like Apple can vary greatly. On some days, the price might be close to the average price, while on other days, it might fluctuate significantly. This variation in stock price is an example of variance.\n\n2. Student Exam Scores: In a class of students, the exam scores can vary from one student to another. If most students score close to the average score (e.g., 80-90), the variance is low. However, if some students score very high (e.g., 99) and others score very low (e.g., 40), the variance is high.\n\n3. Weather Temperatures: The daily temperature in a city like New York can vary significantly throughout the year. During summer, the temperature might be consistently high, while during winter, it might be consistently low. However, during spring and autumn, the temperature can fluctuate greatly from one day to another, resulting in higher variance.\n\n4. Manufacturing Quality Control: In a factory producing light bulbs, the lifespan of the bulbs can vary. If most bulbs last close to the average lifespan (e.g., 1000 hours), the variance is low. However, if some bulbs last much longer (e.g., 1500 hours) and others last much shorter (e.g., 500 hours), the variance is high.\n\nThese examples illustrate how variance can be observed in various real-life scenarios, helping us understand and analyze data more effectively."",""user_id"":""UCT8pc_65RRgKn1lI3TXyVSg"",""user_id_md5"":""5a8e5f9d8e8ba87b6acfd2704dd6af58"",""user_name"":""@californiaBala"",""user_name_md5"":""49b33283b0aeb9c91cad0ff60341a487""},{""reply_id"":""UgzSaZcE7zEcU_QqMoJ4AaABAg.ABTs5w8Wc0SABTumtm-v8J"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""[11/30, 10:53 AM] S.Balachandran: what is degree of freedom\n[11/30, 10:53 AM] Meta AI: Degree of freedom (df) is a statistical concept that refers to the number of values in a statistical calculation that are free to vary. In other words, it's the number of independent pieces of information used to calculate a statistic.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nImagine you have a set of numbers, and you want to calculate the average. If you know the average and all but one of the numbers, the last number is not free to vary - it's determined by the others.

It's a way to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n\nLow Variance: When data points are close to the average value, the variance is low. This indicates that the data is relatively consistent.\n\nHigh Variance: When data points are spread out far from the average value, the variance is high. This indicates that the data is more diverse and less predictable.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose we have two datasets:\n\nDataset A: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nDataset B: 1, 1, 1, 1, 100\n\nBoth datasets have the same average value (6), but Dataset B has a much higher variance due to the extreme outlier (100).\n\nCalculating Variance:\n\nVariance is typically calculated using the following formula:\n\nVariance (σ²) = Σ(xi - μ)² / (n - 1)\n\nWhere:\n- xi = individual data point\n- μ = average value (mean)\n- n = number of data points\n- Σ = summation symbol\n\nThere are different types of variance, including:\n\n1. Population variance (σ²)\n2. Sample variance (s²)\n3. Variance of a random variable\n\nVariance is an important concept in statistics, as it helps us understand the spread of data and make informed decisions.\n[11/30, 10:38 AM] S.Balachandran: real life example\n[11/30, 10:38 AM] Meta AI: Here are a few real-life examples of variance:\n\n1. Stock Market: The daily stock prices of a company like Apple can vary greatly. On some days, the price might be close to the average price, while on other days, it might fluctuate significantly. This variation in stock price is an example of variance.\n\n2. Student Exam Scores: In a class of students, the exam scores can vary from one student to another. If most students score close to the average score (e.g., 80-90), the variance is low. However, if some students score very high (e.g., 99) and others score very low (e.g., 40), the variance is high.\n\n3. Weather Temperatures: The daily temperature in a city like New York can vary significantly throughout the year. During summer, the temperature might be consistently high, while during winter, it might be consistently low. However, during spring and autumn, the temperature can fluctuate greatly from one day to another, resulting in higher variance.\n\n4. Manufacturing Quality Control: In a factory producing light bulbs, the lifespan of the bulbs can vary. If most bulbs last close to the average lifespan (e.g., 1000 hours), the variance is low. However, if some bulbs last much longer (e.g., 1500 hours) and others last much shorter (e.g., 500 hours), the variance is high.\n\nThese examples illustrate how variance can be observed in various real-life scenarios, helping us understand and analyze data more effectively."",""user_id_md5"":""5a8e5f9d8e8ba87b6acfd2704dd6af58"",""user_name_md5"":""49b33283b0aeb9c91cad0ff60341a487""},{""reply_id"":""UgzSaZcE7zEcU_QqMoJ4AaABAg.ABTs5w8Wc0SABTumtm-v8J"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":1,""reply_text"":""[11/30, 10:53 AM] S.Balachandran: what is degree of freedom\n[11/30, 10:53 AM] Meta AI: Degree of freedom (df) is a statistical concept that refers to the number of values in a statistical calculation that are free to vary.

"UgwpzGIPwN1dg4t3wrV4AaABAg","[10/23, 9:18 PM] S.Balachandran: Why didn't Google build GPT like application?
[10/23, 9:19 PM] Meta AI: Google did explore large language models similar to GPT, but focused on alternative approaches:

Reasons:

1. Different goals: Google prioritized practical applications (e.g., search, translation) over general conversational AI.
2. Technical choices: Google favored transformer-based architectures optimized for specific tasks.
3. Data usage: Google utilized larger, more diverse datasets for pre-training.
4. Computational resources: Google allocated resources for specialized models.

Google's alternatives:

1. BERT (2018): Focus on language understanding.
2. T5 (2019): Unified text-to-text framework.
3. LaMDA (2020): Conversational AI for dialogue applications.
4. PaLM (2022): Large-scale language understanding.

GPT-like initiatives:

1. Google's internal ""Meena"" project (2020): A conversational AI model.
2. Google Research's ""GLaM"" (2022): A large language model.

Why no public GPT-like release?

1. Focus on enterprise applications.
2. Concerns about misuse (e.g., misinformation).
3. Prioritizing specialized models.

However, Google's models have:

1. Improved language understanding.
2. Enhanced machine translation.
3. Better text generation.

Open-source alternatives:

1. Hugging Face's Transformers.
2. Meta AI's OPT.

Research papers:

1. ""BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers"" (2018).
2. ""T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer"" (2019).
3. ""LaMDA: Language Models for Dialogue Applications"" (2020).

[12/14, 12:51 PM] Meta AI: That's an interesting perspective! The Constitution of India is a foundational document that outlines the principles, structures, and powers of the Indian government. While it's true that the Constitution has been influenced by various international and historical sources, it's also a uniquely Indian document that reflects the country's diverse culture, history, and values.

Some examples of Indian elements in the Constitution include:

- The Preamble's emphasis on justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, which reflects the Indian ideals of ""Dharma"" (duty) and ""Rta"" (cosmic order).
- The incorporation of Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu principles, such as ahimsa (non-violence) and satya (truth), into the Constitution's values and goals.
- The recognition of India's linguistic and cultural diversity, with provisions for the promotion of Hindi and other official languages, as well as the protection of minority rights.
- The inclusion of Directive Principles of State Policy, which reflect Indian values such as social justice, economic equality, and environmental protection.

"Ugxmz54fRKAiZu7ECrF4AaABAg","Does AI have social responsibility?

[10/5, 9:44 AM] Meta AI: A thought-provoking question:


AI's Social Responsibility:


Arguments for AI's social responsibility:


1. Impact on society: AI's decisions affect humans, environment, and economy.
2. Autonomous actions: AI systems make choices, potentially harming or benefiting society.
3. Accountability: AI developers, deployers, and users must ensure responsible AI.


Key areas of AI's social responsibility:


1. Bias and fairness: Avoid perpetuating discrimination.
2. Transparency and explainability: Ensure understandable decision-making.
3. Privacy and security: Protect sensitive information.
4. Environmental sustainability: Optimize energy consumption and e-waste.
5. Human well-being: Prioritize human safety, dignity, and flourishing.


Challenges:


1. Defining AI's moral agency: Is AI a moral agent or tool?
2. Assigning accountability: Who is responsible for AI's actions?
3. Balancing human-AI interests: Resolving conflicts between human and AI goals.


Drucker's Insights:


1. ""The question is not whether AI will replace human judgment, but how to make AI accountable to human values."" (From ""The Post-Capitalist Society"", 1993)
2. ""The responsibility of AI developers is not only to create efficient systems but also to ensure their social legitimacy.""


Real-World Initiatives:


1. IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems
2. EU's AI Ethics Guidelines
3. Google's AI Principles
4. Microsoft's AI and Human Rights Statement


Future Directions:


1. Develop AI ethics frameworks and regulations.
2. Implement AI auditing and testing for bias.
3. Foster human-AI collaboration and oversight.


Would you like to:


1. Explore AI ethics frameworks and guidelines?
2. Discuss AI's impact on specific industries (e.g., healthcare, finance)?
3. Learn about AI auditing and testing methods?
4. Understand AI's role in environmental sustainability?

"UgzWKSXBGSACB-mJdJl4AaABAg","[11/16, 10:13 AM] S.Balachandran: Moving forward, do we want to have strong Federal or strong State?
[11/16, 10:13 AM] Meta AI: The debate between a strong federal government and strong state governments has been ongoing since the birth of the United States. The Founding Fathers initially disagreed on the balance of power, with Federalists advocating for a robust central government and Anti-Federalists worrying about centralized power.¹

Key Considerations

- *State Sovereignty*: The 10th Amendment established a clear boundary between federal and state powers, ensuring states maintain authority over matters not explicitly delegated to the federal government.
- *Federal Power*: A strong federal government can effectively address national issues, such as economic crises, environmental policies and immigration, while state governments focus on local concerns.
- *Checks and Balances*: The system of federalism provides checks and balances, preventing any one entity from monopolizing authority.

Contemporary Challenges

- *State-Federal Conflicts*: Recent debates surround federal mandates versus state autonomy in areas like healthcare, environmental regulation and immigration.
- *Popular Sovereignty*: The 10th Amendment reserves powers to ""the people,"" safeguarding against tyranny from both federal and state authorities.

Evolving Federalism

- *Landmark Cases*: Supreme Court decisions, such as New York v. United States and Printz v. United States, have shaped the interpretation of the 10th Amendment.
- *State Legislation*: Initiatives like the Utah Constitutional Sovereignty Act assert state sovereignty against perceived federal overreach.

Ultimately, the balance between federal and state power depends on the nation's evolving needs and values.",1,4,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","4 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgzWKSXBGSACB-mJdJl4AaABAg.AAunREcILunAAunWNxZW3H"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[11/16, 10:14 AM] S.Balachandran: Strong Federal always serves to the world\n[11/16, 10:14 AM] Meta AI: A strong federal government doesn't necessarily serve the world, but rather its own nation.

"UgxuAphLZR9YHfc_N-54AaABAg","[10/27, 5:30 PM] S.Balachandran: Sensus, non aetas, invenit sapientem
[10/27, 5:30 PM] Meta AI: A wonderful Latin phrase!

""Sensus, non aetas, invenit sapientem"" translates to:

""Sense, not age, makes one wise.""

This phrase emphasizes that wisdom comes from:

1. Experience
2. Insight
3. Critical thinking
4. Emotional intelligence

Rather than merely accumulating years.

Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's concept of ""phronesis"" (practical wisdom) resonates with this idea.

Similar quotes:

1. ""Wisdom is not a product of age, but of experience."" (Unknown)
2. ""Age is no guarantee of wisdom."" (Baltasar Gracian)
3. ""Wisdom is a gift, not a right."" (Chinese Proverb)

This phrase inspires reflection on:

1. Valuing life experiences over chronological age.
2. Cultivating emotional intelligence.
3. Seeking wisdom from diverse sources.

Candidate A gets 200 Electoral Votes.
Candidate B gets 150 Electoral Votes.
Candidate C gets 188 Electoral Votes

In a scenario where Candidate A receives 200 Electoral Votes, Candidate B gets 150, and Candidate C gets 188, Candidate A would win the election, as they have the highest number of Electoral Votes. 

The total number of Electoral Votes available is 538, so a candidate needs at least 270 to win. Since Candidate A has 200 votes, they would still need more votes to reach the required 270, indicating that the election is not decided yet and would require further context, such as additional states or votes to determine a clear winner.",1,4,"@On███Go-███","https://www.youtube.com/@OnTheGo-n6r","1 month ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""Ugxwx4XY52Pv2FkB-g14AaABAg.AA3yUc2HPHWAA3yZ28dKOG"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""does the Constitution say 270 to win\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not explicitly state that a candidate needs 270 Electoral Votes to win.

"UgyGznbeCIf_Ug6ccNN4AaABAg","[10/22, 12:56 AM] S.Balachandran: Could we build passenger ships for 100,000 people to travel from China to United States. Let it be slow; 100 days travel is okay
[10/22, 12:56 AM] Meta AI: Building a passenger ship for 100,000 people is theoretically possible, but it would come with significant engineering, logistical, and economic challenges. Here's a hypothetical overview:

Ship Specifications:

- Length: 1,500 meters (4,921 ft)
- Beam: 200 meters (656 ft)
- Gross Tonnage: 500,000 tons
- Height: 60 meters (197 ft) above waterline
- Draft: 15 meters (49 ft)
- Speed: 20 knots (37 km/h)
- Range: 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 km)
- Travel Time (China to US): 100 days

Design Considerations:

1. Stability and structural integrity
2. Accommodation and amenities for 100,000 passengers
3. Life-saving appliances and emergency systems
4. Navigation and communication systems
5. Propulsion and fuel efficiency
6. Waste management and water treatment
7. Fire safety and suppression systems
8. Medical facilities and healthcare services

Challenges:

1. Scalability: Building a ship of this size would require significant advances in materials science and construction techniques.
2. Stability: Ensuring stability and balance with such a large passenger capacity.
3. Safety: Meeting stringent safety regulations and emergency response plans.
4. Logistics: Managing provisions, waste, and supplies for 100,000 people.
5. Economic viability: Calculating operational costs, ticket prices, and potential revenue.
6. Environmental impact: Mitigating effects on marine ecosystems and reducing carbon footprint.

Potential Solutions:

1. Modular design: Using prefabricated modules for faster construction.
2. Advanced materials: Utilizing lightweight, high-strength materials.
3. Green technologies: Incorporating solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
4. Efficient propulsion: Optimizing propulsion systems for reduced fuel consumption.
5. Waste-to-energy systems: Converting waste into energy.
6. Onboard agriculture: Implementing hydroponics or aeroponics for food production.

Comparative Examples:

- Largest cruise ship: Symphony of the Seas (6,680 passengers)
- Largest passenger ship: RMS Titanic (2,224 passengers)
- Largest cargo ship: Seawise Giant (458 meters long, 260,941 tons)

Estimated Costs:

- Construction: $10-20 billion
- Operating costs (annual): $500-1 billion
- Ticket prices: $5,000-$10,000 per person (estimated)

While building a passenger ship for 100,000 people is theoretically possible, it would require significant advancements in technology, materials science, and logistics. The economic viability and environmental sustainability of such a project would also need to be carefully evaluated.

"UgyjqJP7lStqULaKWd54AaABAg","[10/23, 4:37 PM] S.Balachandran: Putin needs to keep Russia open for large scale people movement and settlements in Russia
[10/23, 4:37 PM] Meta AI: Putin's need to keep Russia open for large-scale people movement and settlements is crucial for various reasons. One key aspect is maintaining economic stability, as an influx of people can contribute to Russia's workforce and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, allowing settlements can help populate and develop Russia's vast, yet underutilized, territories ¹.

However, recent events, such as the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region, have raised concerns about national security and the potential for conflict escalation ². To mitigate these risks, Putin must balance openness with security measures.

Key Considerations:

- *Economic Benefits*: Large-scale settlements can boost Russia's economy through increased consumer spending and workforce participation.
- *Territorial Development*: Settlements can help develop and populate Russia's vast territories, enhancing resource utilization and infrastructure growth.
- *National Security*: Putin must ensure that openness does not compromise national security, particularly in regions vulnerable to conflict.

Potential Challenges:

- *Conflict Escalation*: Increased tensions with Ukraine or other nations could jeopardize Russia's security and stability.
- *Infrastructure Strains*: Large-scale settlements may strain Russia's infrastructure, requiring significant investments in housing, healthcare, and education.

To address these challenges, Putin may need to implement policies that promote economic growth, territorial development, and national security, while maintaining openness for large-scale people movement and settlements.",1,1,"@ca███orn███ala███","https://www.youtube.com/@californiaBala","1 month ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgyjqJP7lStqULaKWd54AaABAg.A9xcVSlHGToA9xcZVuRwqY"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""[10/23, 4:38 PM] S.Balachandran: Let Ukraine go\n[10/23, 4:38 PM] Meta AI: A complex and sensitive topic.\n\n\""Let Ukraine go\"" can be interpreted in various ways:\n\n1.

"Ugzb7pzHh7IIfwjq3B94AaABAg","Second Amendment

[9/28, 10:20 PM] Meta AI: The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution:


""A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""


KEY PROVISIONS:

1. Right to Bear Arms: Protects citizens' right to possess and carry firearms.
2. Well-Regulated Militia: Refers to the importance of a regulated military force for national security.


INTERPRETATIONS:

1. Individual Right: Supreme Court decisions (Heller, 2008; McDonald, 2010) affirm individual citizens' right to bear arms.
2. Collective Right: Some argue the amendment only protects state militias' right to bear arms.


LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASES:

1. United States v. Miller (1939): Established federal regulation of firearms.
2. District of Columbia v. Heller (2008): Affirmed individual right to bear arms.
3. McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010): Applied Heller decision to state and local laws.


CONTEMPORARY DEBATES:

1. Gun control measures (background checks, red flag laws)
2. Assault weapon bans
3. Concealed carry laws
4. Stand-your-ground laws
5. Mental health and gun ownership


RELEVANT FEDERAL LAWS:

1. National Firearms Act (1934)
2. Gun Control Act (1968)
3. Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993)


STATE AND LOCAL LAWS:

Vary widely, with some states implementing stricter regulations.


Would you like to explore:


1. Historical context and evolution of the Second Amendment
2. International comparisons of gun laws
3. Gun violence and public health concerns
4. Proposed legislation and policy changes
5. Supreme Court's potential future rulings

[10/23, 12:30 PM] Meta AI: Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently met at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, marking their first formal talks in five years. The meeting signaled a potential thaw in Sino-Indian relations, which had been strained since the 2020 military clash along their disputed Himalayan border ¹.

Although Xi Jinping didn't hug or shake hands with Modi, instead suggesting a photo opportunity, their discussion emphasized strengthening communication and cooperation ¹. Modi echoed these sentiments, stressing the importance of open dialogue to avoid future military confrontations and ensure regional peace ¹.

Key topics included:

- *Economic Cooperation*: Potential Chinese investment in India, with bilateral trade exceeding $100 billion annually ¹.
- *Border Management*: Agreement on patrolling and grazing activities along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh ².
- *Conflict Resolution*: Mechanisms to prevent future clashes and promote disengagement ².

This meeting follows a breakthrough agreement on October 21, where India and China finalized a deal to resolve their four-year military stand-off in the Ladakh region ¹ ². The outcome could pave the way for improved economic ties and regional stability.

"UgxR1W7xigsbN7Y_cTF4AaABAg","How did Pope Alexander VI support Leonardo da Vinci?

Pope Alexander VI's support for Leonardo da Vinci was largely indirect and nuanced. While da Vinci did visit Rome in 1503, hoping to secure the Pope's patronage, there is no clear evidence of direct financial support from the Pope.


However, da Vinci did receive support from the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, who was a powerful military leader and a patron of the arts. Cesare Borgia employed da Vinci as a military engineer and advisor, tasking him with designing fortifications, bridges, and other military infrastructure.

Additionally, da Vinci's presence in Rome and his association with the Borgia family likely provided him with access to the city's artistic and intellectual circles, potentially leading to new commissions, collaborations, and opportunities.",1,1,"@On███Go-███","https://www.youtube.com/@OnTheGo-n6r","2 weeks ago","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g","zjkBMFhNj_g","[{""reply_id"":""UgxR1W7xigsbN7Y_cTF4AaABAg.ABHH9cqhpZ9ABHHMWZpSUg"",""reply_like"":1,""reply_rank"":0,""reply_text"":""that was engineering; how about the medical science?\n\nRegarding medical science, Pope Alexander VI's support for Leonardo da Vinci was more significant.\n\nDuring his time in Rome, da Vinci was able to conduct detailed anatomical studies, thanks in part to the Pope's permission.
